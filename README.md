ENGO 551 - Adv. Topics on Geospatial Technologies

This project is an HTML webpage all about me and the top 3 injuries that I have sustained in my recent life. 
Not considering the README, you will find a total of 17 files in the repository, including 10 photos, 4 HTML files for each page, a .scss stylesheet

file, a .css.map file made by the SCSS compiler, and finally the CSS stylesheet file.

JPEGS
	The photos are all named HTMLPhoto(1-11) *10 is missing*

HTML files
	Index.HTML 
		This is the main page of my site, it gives a quick description of what to expect along with a quick introduction using photos and a small
		list at the bottom.
	injury1.HTML
		This page describes my first injury with the use of a table and imagery.
	injury2.HTML
		This page is all about injury #2, being shown off by my swollen foot and x-ray. 
	injury3.HTML
